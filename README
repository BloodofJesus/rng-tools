This is a random number generator daemon.

It monitors a hardware random number generator, and supplies entropy
from that to the system kernel's /dev/random machinery.

It is hoped that future contributions will enable entropy gathering
from other sources, such as audio hardware or video hardware or CPU
instruction pointers, to provide entropy even in cases where a true
hardware RNG is not present.
